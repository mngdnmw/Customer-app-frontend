<!--for loop inside angular: let - creates a local variable called cust
For each cust inside the customers array, I'm going to create an app-customers component/tag
and each of them are going to getAll a reference to the cust and that's going to be passed
to customers-->
<h1> Customers </h1>
<app-customer
  *ngFor="let cust of customers"
  [customer]="cust"></app-customer>
